The project contains 4 main pages, each linked through a consistent navigation bar and footer:

- **Home (`index.html`)** – Landing page with introduction and navigation.  
- **About (`about.html`)** – Information about the purpose of the site.  
- **Services (`services.html`)** – Showcasing offerings/features.  
- **Contact (`contact.html`)** – Includes a contact form with basic JavaScript validation.  

### Supporting Files:
- **`style.css`** – Centralized styling with a consistent color scheme and responsiveness.
